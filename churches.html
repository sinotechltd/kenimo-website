        <strong> 1. Mobile apps increase your value to congregation.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
         bottom line? Being mobile-friendly is non-negotiable. An application is the most impactful way to embrace mobile-friendliness because of its sheer value to your customers. The most prominent benefit is access. Today’s customers spend approximately 2 hours and 51 minutes on their mobile devices per day. 
        The app gives them a chance to interact with you at any time they please, without the need to switch devices. This gives you plenty of opportunities to serve congregation in a multitude of ways

        <strong> 2. Mobile apps increase congregation engagement.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Message value to the congregation is one thing. But engagement is next level. One of the biggest advantages of the mobile channel is that it allows to connect and engage with the audience in real-time, develop trusting relationships and guide them through each step of the life cycle.  </p>

          <strong> 3. Mobile apps offer a path to market preeminence.</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          If you want to be positioned as the preeminent solution in your market, you need to increase your competitive value. Our mobile app does just that and for two reasons. The more value you provide to congregation, the more you stand out as the superior solution to their problems. 
        As your congregation acquisition increases, you get to capture a larger share of your market. And that’s how market dominance is achieved.
