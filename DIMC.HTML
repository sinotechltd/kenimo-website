       <div class="topic">GO GREEN GO PAPAERLESS</div>
       <p>The main reason we came up with the idea of  DIGITAL INSURANCE MEDICAL CLAIM FORM  is to help with the fight against corona virus and at the same time campaign for the GO GREEN, GO PAPERLESS initiative which is advocating for institutions to go paperless.                     
        <br>
        <br>DMIC is a mobile application that will allow patients during this pandemic period to visit their favorite hospitals with out the fear of contracting or spreading the virus.  

        <br>
        <br>
        Proponents say the DIMC will be successful because everyone wins. The consumer enjoys a more interactive and customer-focused visit while HOSPITALS AND INSURANCE FIRMS benefit from a wealth of data and have less paper work involved. The new system is set to improve the efficiency of operations of the Hospitals and insurance firms. 
        <BR>
          <BR>
            The application aims to improve customer experience through;  

        <br>
        <br>
        ⦁	Protecting them from contracting or spreading the corona virus. 
<BR>
        ⦁	Saving time.
<BR> 
⦁	 Avoiding long queues in the hospital.
<BR>
⦁	Having a personal Ai assistant in the app will guide an individual on how to fill the forms.
