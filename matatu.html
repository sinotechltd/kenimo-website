        Traditional data management processes make it difficult to scale capabilities without compromising governance or security. No matter how successful and well managed your Matatu is, work sheet handling has been stressful due to a lot of circumstances, the digital work sheet makes it easier to handle and manage matatu work sheets.

       <div class="topic"></div>
       <p>The Digital Matatu Work Sheet is a QR based web app that typically works like the normal manual work sheet.
        Since it’s a Qr based web app, it means each and every matatu will have its own unique QR code. The QR code is the gateway to access the work sheet form.
        <br>
        <br>
        The process starts once the matatu has completed its trip since the sheet will be filled after every trip to give the records a timestamp. At the end of the trip the driver or conductor or stage attendant scans the matatu's Qr code to access the work sheet form.
        
        
        Date, Drivers name, Conductors name, type of trip and income generated during the trip are the details filled in the first page of the form.
        <br>
        <br>
         After filling the first page of the form, one is prompted to go to the next page which is the Expenses page form. <br>
        In the Expenses page form, one is required to key in the expenses incurred during the trip.
        <br>
        <br>
        On the admin side an Admin Dashboard will be provided where all the data collected will be showcased; all the trips timestamp, income, individual expenses incurred, Total daily income, Total daily expenses, Total monthly income, Total monthly expenses, Total annual income and Total annual expenses.
        The will be reports for four models which are Collection/Sales, Inventory, Purchases and Accounting.</p>
