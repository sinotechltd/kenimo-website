       <H14><strong>ADVANTAGES OF USING PARK & SHOP. </STRONG></H14> 
          <br>
        <br>
        <br> 
        CONVENIENCE. Convenience is the biggest perk. Where else can you comfortably shop in two shops or more in your car or roaming around in a mall? There are no lines to wait in or cashiers to track down to help you with your purchases, and you can do your shopping in minutes.  
        The application gives the opportunity to shop effortlessly, and also reward us with a ‘no pollution’ shopping experience. The app also prevents the spread of the corona virus as business is conducted as usual in these malls. 
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
EASY PRICE COMPARISON. Comparing and researching products and their prices is so much easier through our application. If you're shopping for appliances, for example, you can find consumer reviews and product comparisons for all the options on the market, with links to the best prices. 
        We can research firsthand experience, ratings, and reviews for most products and retailers.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
       NO CROWDS. At the moment people are advised not to crowd and this application will help shoppers not to crowd in the malls and adhere to all the covid mitigation rules ( Zero contact).  Or If you are like me, you hate crowds when you're shopping. Especially during holidays, festivals, or on weekends, they can be such a huge headache. Also, being crushed in the crowds of shoppers sometimes makes us feel rushed or hurried. 
        All of these problems can be avoided when you shop through the application.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
     DISCREET PURCHASE. Some things are better done in the privacy of your home. The application is the best for discreet purchases for things like adult toys, sexy lingerie, and so on. This enables me to purchase undergarments and lingerie without embarrassment.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
       SAVES TIME. Shopping online via the application will save time for both the customer and seller since it will provide a fast interface for shopping and this will reduce ques in supermarkets and the stores within the mall. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Read first-hand reviews from real customers. Customers will be able to give reviews about all the products giving insight about the products to other customers.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Offer safe shopping; security and handling of goods during transportation is done carefully and the application will provide safe online payments for the goods.
